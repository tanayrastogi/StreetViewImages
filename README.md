# StreetViewImages
Module for downloading high-resolution Google Street View images given (lat, lng) using Google Street View Service. 


# Usage
The module assumes that, 
- Selinium with Python is already setup.
- API key from Google Cloud to access the Street View API is stored in file called *.key*

Check **example.py** on how to use. 

## TODO
- Have to still fix the installation of the webdrivers for selenium. I have not figured out on how to setup selenium in WSL.
